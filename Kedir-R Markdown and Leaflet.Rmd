```

## Background
Create a web page using R Markdown that features a map created with Leaflet.

Host your webpage on either GitHub Pages, RPubs, or NeoCities.

Your webpage must contain the date that you created the document, and it must contain a map created with Leaflet. We would love to see you show off your creativity!

## Assignment:

```{r}
library(leaflet)
```

```{r}
m_map <- leaflet() %>% addTiles()   
m_map <- m_map %>% addMarkers(lat= 21.020486345650983, lng= 105.76528349150303, popup="Search here for White House Penssylvania avenue, Washington, DC ")
m_map  
```
